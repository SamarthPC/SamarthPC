### In God we trust, but everyone else must bring data! ðŸ‘‹

I am Samarth, a graduate student at Northeastern currently pursuing my Master's degree in Data Analytics Engineering at Northeastern University, Boston, MA.

I completed a three-month long internship at a local company in India where I was acquainted with the basics of EDA and predictive analytics. I also completed six-months as an Artificial Intelligece Research Intern at my undergradute university where I learnt about data in depth. I also understood the significance that algorithms play in today's world. All in all, I love immersing myself in data and always digging deep to find the nichest of insights.

I am looking forward to collaborating on projects related to data science. I love solving real-world problems and leveraging modern tools and technologies to extract meaningful insights from data. I also love applying machine learning algorithms to datasets and presenting my findings in a precise, yet pretty way. 

I have completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Engineering back home in India and I have taken the following courses during my master's journey so far:

IE 6400 - Foundations of Data Analytics Engineering
DAMG 6210 - Data Management and Database Design
IE 6600 - Computation and Visualization for Analytics
OR 6205 - Deterministic Operations Research

Upcoming courses include - 

Statistical Methods
Data Mining
Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning 
Cloud Computing

I am looking for mentors, collaborators and like-minded individuals who can guide me throughout my journey in the world of data
