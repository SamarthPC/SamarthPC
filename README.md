### In God we trust, but everyone else must bring data! ðŸ‘‹

Hello there! I'm Samarth. I'm a data science enthusiast and have a Master's degree in Data Analytics Engineering from Northeastern University, Boston, MA.

During my academic journey, I've gained hands-on experience through a couple of internships in India, where I delved into the basics of EDA and predictive analytics. Further fueling my passion, I've now spent almost a year as a Data Analyst and Solutions Architect @ Merck, exploring the intricate world of data and recognizing the pivotal role data plays in today's landscape, with sustainability being one of my main focuses!

Equipped with a degree in Computer Science and Engineering from India, I've honed my skills through relevant coursework during my PG degree, including:
- IE 6400 - Foundations of Data Analytics Engineering
- IE 6600 - Computation and Visualization for Analytics
- IE 7275 - Data Mining in Engineering
- IE 7280 - Statistical Methods in Engineering
- DAMG 6210 - Data Management and Database Design
- OR 6205 - Deterministic Operations Research
- EMGT 5220 - Engineering Project Management
- EMGT 6305 - Financial Management for Engineers

I am actively seeking full-time opportunities in the data space. My passion lies in solving real-world problems by leveraging modern tools and technologies to extract meaningful insights from data. I specialize in applying machine learning algorithms to datasets and presenting findings in a precise yet visually compelling manner.

I am eager to collaborate with mentors, like-minded individuals, and potential collaborators who can guide me on this exciting journey into the world of data. If you have insights to share or if you're looking for a dedicated and enthusiastic team member, I'd love to connect! Feel free to reach out via email at chetan.s@northeastern.edu.

Let's make data tell its story together!
