### In God we trust, but everyone else must bring data! ðŸ‘‹

Hello there! I'm Samarth, a passionate data enthusiast and a graduate student pursuing a Master's degree in Data Analytics Engineering at Northeastern University, Boston, MA.

During my academic journey, I've gained hands-on experience through a three-month internship at a local company in India, where I delved into the basics of EDA and predictive analytics. Further fueling my passion, I spent six months as an Artificial Intelligence Research Intern at my undergraduate university, exploring the intricate world of data and recognizing the pivotal role algorithms play in today's landscape.

Equipped with a degree in Computer Science and Engineering from India, I've honed my skills through relevant coursework, including:
- IE 6400 - Foundations of Data Analytics Engineering
- IE 6600 - Computation and Visualization for Analytics
- IE 7275 - Data Mining in Engineering
- IE 7280 - Statistical Methods in Engineering
- DAMG 6210 - Data Management and Database Design
- OR 6205 - Deterministic Operations Research

I am actively seeking opportunities for internships or full-time roles in the field of data science. My passion lies in solving real-world problems by leveraging modern tools and technologies to extract meaningful insights from data. I specialize in applying machine learning algorithms to datasets and presenting findings in a precise yet visually compelling manner.

I am eager to collaborate with mentors, like-minded individuals, and potential collaborators who can guide me on this exciting journey into the world of data. If you have insights to share or if you're looking for a dedicated and enthusiastic team member, I'd love to connect! Feel free to reach out via email at chetan.s@northeastern.edu.

Let's make data tell its story together!
